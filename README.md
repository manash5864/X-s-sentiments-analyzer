# X-s-sentiments-analyzer

This project focuses on analyzing sentiments in tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a logistic regression model. The goal is to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The process begins with collecting Twitter data using the Tweepy API. The tweets are then cleaned and preprocessed by removing URLs, special characters, and stop words, followed by tokenization.

Features are extracted using TF-IDF vectorization, converting the text data into a format suitable for machine learning. A logistic regression model is trained on labeled tweets to learn sentiment patterns. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, demonstrating the ability to accurately predict the sentiment of new tweets. This project provides insights into public opinion on various topics and can be further enhanced.
